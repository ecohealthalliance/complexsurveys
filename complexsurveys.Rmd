## What are complex surveys?

* A population is specified; data values unknown but are fixed (not random);

* A random sample is drawn from the population. This is what we call the **sample design**;

* Given **sample design**, probabilities can be known/calculated;

* Analysis of complex survey samples aims to estimate features of the fixed population hence is a **design-based inference**.

---

## Complex survey design

* **Probability samples** or **random samples** - procedure for taking samples from a population and not just the data we happen to end up with. 

* **Probability samples** or **random samples** is a fundamental concept in design-based inference;

* Involves a sampling procedure that draws any subset of X number from the population with an equal likelihood of being selected.

---

## Complex survey design: simple random sample

* Drawing a sample of X number from a full list of members of a fixed population.

## Complex survey design: systematic sample

* Determine a **sampling interval**

$$ \text{sampling interval} ~ = ~ \left \lfloor \frac{\text{number of samples needed}}{\text{total number of population}} \right \rfloor $$

* Select a random number from the series of numbers between 1 and the sampling interval. This will be the **random starting point** for the systematic selection.

* Using the **random starting point** and the **sampling interval**, select the samples from a list of all members of the population starting from the random starting point position and then for every successive sampling interval position.

```

---

## Complex survey design: stratified random sample/clustered random sample

* Draw a simple random sample of Y number from each sub-grouping or strata or cluster of the population to get X number of sample from the total population; or,

* Draw a simple random sample of Z number from a simple random sample of Y number of sub-grouping or strata or cluster of the population to get X number of sample from the total population.

---

## Complex survey design: sample size

* Sample size estimation will be dictated by the complex survey design;

* Rule of thumb: A sample drawn via **simple random sample** will require smaller sample sizes compared to a sample drawn with stratification or clustering;

* Stratified and/or cluster samples often require some form of sample size inflation to account for loss of sampling variance due to increase homogeneity of samples from within a cluster.

---

## Complex survey analysis

* Complex survey analysis is shaped by the survey design;

* Analysis must factor in how the sample was drawn and the probabilities of a sample being selected;

* The probability of a sample being selected is called its **sampling weight**;

* The **sampling weight** is used to calibrate the contribution of sample to the overall outcome measure/indicator.

* Analysis that doesn't take into account survey design and **sampling weight** can potentially produce biased (inaccurate) results.

---

## Using R for complex survey analysis: `{survey}` package

* `{survey}` package authored and maintained by Thomas Lumley is the main R package that provides functions for implementing complex survey analysis;

* It can be installed from CRAN and loaded to R as follows:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("survey")
library(survey)
```

---

## Using R for complex survey analysis: `{survey}` package

* The typical workflow for complex survey analysis using the `{survey}` package is:

    - Describe the sample design to R and keep as an R object
    
    - Apply required analysis to the design-specified R object

## The `svydesign()` function

This is the main function that allows users to specify the sample design to R

```{r, eval = FALSE}
svydesign(
  ids,                   ## cluster identifieres
  probs = NULL,          ## cluster sampling probabilities
  strata = NULL,         ## strata specification
  variables = NULL,      
  fpc = NULL,            ## finite population correction
  data = NULL,           ## data
  nest = FALSE,          ## is data nested within strata?
  weights = NULL         ## sampling weights (alternative to probs)
)
```

## Example of an analysis on a simple random sample

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(survey)     # Load survey package
data(api)           # Load api dataset

## Describe simple random sample design
srs_design <- svydesign(ids = ~1, data = apisrs)

## Estimate the population mean of enrollees across the schools
svymean(~enroll, srs_design)
```

---

## Example of an analysis on a simple random sample

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## Estimate the population total of enrollees across the schools
svytotal(~enroll, srs_design)

## Estimate the total number of different types of schools in California
svytotal(~stype, srs_design)
```
    
---

# Examples of an analysis on a stratified sample

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## Describe stratified sample design
strat_design <- svydesign(ids = ~1, strata = ~stype, fpc = ~fpc, data = apistrat)

## Estimate the population mean of enrollees
svymean(~enroll, strat_design)
```

---

# Examples of an analysis on a stratified sample

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## Estimate the population total of enrollees
svytotal(~enroll, strat_design)

## Estimate the total number of enrollees by school type
svytotal(~stype, strat_design)
```
